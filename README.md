There is also a small feature to practice common nouns.

The app is hosted at [https://genre-substantif.vercel.app/](https://genre-substantif.vercel.app/)

You can also check out the [Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/8teTdo1t85HnxdnGEQjYTn/What-the-Noun%3F?node-id=0%3A1) behind this app.

## Roadmap

- Replace the dictionary, words like `Paris` says masculine but is feminine, also many words are missing
- Refactor into separate pages

##Â Credits

I am relying on the noun csv from [/hbenbel/French-Dictionary](https://github.com/hbenbel/French-Dictionary), converted to json, to provide the gender for words.
